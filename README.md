### [EXAMPLE GAMEPLAY](http://ec2-3-138-91-192.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/)

The Astor Mansion was a historic mansion in New York City, known for its opulence and intriguing history. It provides a sense of grandeur and mystery while not immediately revealing its New York connection.

Now, let's delve into the gameplay aspect. Betrayal at House on the Hill is known for its exploration and the eventual betrayal twist. 

## Here are some ideas for gameplay:

### Exploration: 
Players start in the lavish Astor Mansion, each with unique characters or roles. They explore the mansion, uncovering rooms, events, and items. Use Aleo's privacy features to ensure that some discoveries are kept hidden from others.

### Events and Items:
Create a deck of event cards inspired by New York's history and supernatural tales. Similarly, have a deck of item cards with items related to the city's past.
