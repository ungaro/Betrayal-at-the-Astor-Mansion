# Betrayal at the Astor Mansion

##Betrayal Mechanism

Triggering the Betrayal:

The betrayal should be triggered under specific conditions, such as when a player collects a certain item, explores a particular room, or reaches a predetermined point in the game.
Consider having multiple potential triggers, so the exact moment of betrayal remains uncertain.

Revealing the Betrayer:

When the betrayal is triggered, one player (the betrayer) is randomly selected, but this can be influenced by in-game events or choices.
The identity of the betrayer is kept secret from the other players. Only the betrayer knows their role at this point.

Betrayer's Objective:

Define the betrayer's objectives, which could be tied to specific in-game conditions or goals. For example, the betrayer might aim to complete a dark ritual, eliminate other players, or achieve some sinister objective related to the mansion's history.
The betrayer's objectives should remain hidden until a certain point or triggered event.

Betrayer's Powers:

Give the betrayer unique abilities or powers that they can use to hinder or deceive the other players. These could be related to controlling events, manipulating items, or summoning supernatural forces.
The betrayer's powers should align with their objective and be thematic to the haunting storyline.

Survivor's Objective:

For the remaining players (the survivors), define their objectives. These objectives could involve escaping the mansion, uncovering the betrayer's identity, or preventing the betrayer from achieving their goal.
The survivors must work together to achieve their objectives while being wary of the betrayer.


Betrayal Reveal:

At a dramatic point in the game or when certain conditions are met, reveal the identity of the betrayer to all players.
The game then shifts into a new phase where the betrayer openly tries to accomplish their objectives, and the survivors attempt to thwart them.
Alternate Endings:

Consider having multiple potential endings based on whether the betrayer succeeds or the survivors thwart their plans.
Each ending should provide a unique narrative conclusion to the game.
Balancing Act:

Balancing the game is crucial. Ensure that both the betrayer and the survivors have a reasonable chance of achieving their objectives. Adjust game mechanics and win conditions as needed during playtesting.
